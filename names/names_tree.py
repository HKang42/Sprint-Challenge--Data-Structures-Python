# ---------- Binary Tree Solution -----------

# Take advantage of python's built-in string comparison functionality (e.g. "a > b" = False)
# Import my binary tree from Wednesday's assignment
# Loop through first file and construct a binary tree for the first set of names
# Loop through the second set of names and use tree.contains() to check for duplicates.

# ---------- Stretch Goal -----------
# Python has built-in tools that allow for a very efficient approach to this problem
# What's the best time you can accomplish?  Thare are no restrictions on techniques or data
# structures, but you may not import any additional libraries that you did not write yourself.
